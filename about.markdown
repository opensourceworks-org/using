I'm Jeroen. Trying to keep things interesting and working in different area's in Information Technology: backend, data, infrastructure/ops, cloud, monitoring, security, automation ...  

Some things I'm currently working on:

- [deltalake-tools](https://pypi.org/project/deltalake-tools/): A set of easy to use commands for deltalake, with a command line interface. (Python, rewriting in Rust)
- [NotMongo](https://notmongo.opensourceworks.org/): A Maybe DuckDB extension for json APIs (C++)
