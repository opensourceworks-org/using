## First
1. [Website Backends]({{ site.baseurl }}/code/backend/programming/languages/2024/06/22/website-backends.html)

## The Start
Initially, I wanted to get a feel for some of the new cool general purpose programming languages.  I'm using Python extensively on my professional project as a data engineer, so that's pretty much the reference.  That's also how I rolled into looking at Rust ([Polars](https://pola.rs/), [DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org/), [Delta-rs](https://delta-io.github.io/delta-rs/)).  Given Zig's interoperability with C, that's what I'm using to rewrite the excellent-although-slightly-aged lightweight no-nonsense monitoring tool Xymon in.  C# is my son's go-to language and it's supported at my current project as well. And Go, well, hard to ignore it with its pedigree.  Also, it's easy, fast to write, fast to execute, fast to compile, fast to set up, fast to read... 

## Pull the plug (partially)

I think I got a pretty good basic understanding of the languages by now.  Maintaining 5 different backends is impossible with a full time job, family, a dozen other hobbies and interests...
Next, I'll post my findings for each of them (spoiler: they're all great).  For the [portfolio website](https://flexworks.eu), I'll stick to Rust, as that currently, and unfortunately, is the only language I'm not using professionally.

I could have used C/C++ with [facil.io](https://facil.io/) as the reference instead of python, since all the others are compiled too, but I think python is more popular than C/C++, at least for this kind of stuff.
